; Test pre-decrement-indirect-and-then-work-with-it
;
; This test program was used to document and to test, after in Release 1.4
; a CPU bug was discovered, that lead to the strange effect, that in the
; emulator, things like "F" "R" qbin/mandel.out did not work, but in hardware
; it indeed did work. At first, this looked like an emulator bug, but in the
; end it became clear, that the FAT32 implementation relied on a CPU bug to
; work correctly :-)
;
; The original sdcard.asm (and therefore the Monitor-FAT32 implementation)
; contained a statement like this:
;
; ============================================================================
;                ADD     @--R4, R4              ; R4 was incremented to skip..
;                                               ; ..the length information, ..
;                                               ; ..so we need to predecr. ..
;                                               ; ..and then increase the ..
;                                               ; ..pointer to the next segm.                                                
; ============================================================================
;
; It expected from the CPU the following semantics:
;
; ============================================================================
;       int* a = r4;
;       int* b = r4;
;       --a;
;       b += (*a);
;       r4 = b;
; ============================================================================
;
; In other words: It relied on a CPU bug, that had the implication that the
; second operand still had the old value, even when pre-decremented in the
; first part of the command. Obviously, the right semantics need to be:
;
; ============================================================================
;       int* a = r4;
;       --a;
;       a += (*a);
;       r4 = a;
; ============================================================================
;
; This test program therefore checks, if the correct behaviour is shown.
