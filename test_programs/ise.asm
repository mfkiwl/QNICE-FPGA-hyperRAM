; Test program for reproducing "The ISE vs. Vivado riddle" as described on
; GitHub here: https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA/issues/4
;
; What this program does: Reset the hardware cycle counter (which is increased
; at each clock cycle - as the time of making 50 MHz) and the hardware
; instruction counter (which is increased at each new instruction fetch).
;
; Both counters can be used together to measure the MIPS throughput of
; QNICE-FPGA, for example by running the two performance test programs
; "test_programs/mandel_perf_test.asm" and 
; "test_programs/q-tris_perf_test.asm": Both versions of these demos will
; output the amount of cycles and the amount of instructions after they end.
;
; What is expected as an output is something like this:
;
;   Amount of cycles used:            000000000041
;   Amount of instructions performed: 000000000012
;
; These values are hexadecimal values.
