; This is a small test program for vasm and vlink, which can be used as an
; alternative to the native QNICE assembler.
;
; Before proceeding, make sure that you entered "source setenv.source" in
; your terminal, which is located in the "c" folder. This sets the path
; and the environment variables correctly.
;
; Enter this command to assemble, link and to create a QNICE .out file:
; qvasm vasm_test.asm
