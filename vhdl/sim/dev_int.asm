;  Development testbed for the simulation environment "dev_int.vhd"
;
;  This is a simple test program for QNICE interrupts. The idea is as follows:
;
;   1) The program starts writing 1, 2, 3, ... into the data area pointed to
;      by DATA.
;   2) After some of these MOVEs, an interrupt will be requested which will
;      cause a jump to the ISR which writes CCCC to the DATA area.
;   3) The interrupt is finished with RTI which causes a jump back to the
;      next move which will then continue writing the ascending series of 
;      integers to the DATA area.
;
;  The way how dev_int.vhd wires the interrupt_generator (dev_int_source),
;  the expected memory layout is:
;  1, 2, 3, CCCC, CCCC, 4, 5
