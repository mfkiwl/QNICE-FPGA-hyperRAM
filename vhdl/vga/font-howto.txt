how to make fonts, see http://nafe.sourceforge.net/

then use the psf2coe.rb and then coe2rom.pl toolchain to generate .rom files

in case the Source Forge link is not available: nafe-0.1.tar.gz is stored here

alternative: as psf2coe.rb does not seem to work, use

xxd -p -c 1 -u lat9w-12.psfu | sed -e '1,4d' > lat9w-12.coe

to convert "type 1" psfu's that are made by nafe from the original Linux font files to create the .coe
after that: use coe2rom.pl to make a .rom file suitable for QNICE-FPGA
