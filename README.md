QNICE-FPGA
==========

16-bit System-on-a-Chip for learning, teaching and having fun.

This repository contains the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) source code
for QNICE-FPGA's project website and documentation:
[http://sy2002.github.io/QNICE-FPGA](http://sy2002.github.io/QNICE-FPGA)

Switch to the [QNICE-FPGA Master Repository](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA)
to work with the official release package.

Important hint
--------------

Do not name any of the root-level folders like one of these, as they are part
of .gitignore to allow a seamless switch between a regular QNICE git branch
and this special website branch:

* assembler
* c
* demos
* dist_kit
* doc
* emulator
* hw
* monitor
* pore
* qbin
* test_programs
* tools
* vhdl
