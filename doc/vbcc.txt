VBCC is able to use QNICE's register bank feature:

If -speed is set, then VBCC evaluates -rw-threshold, which is 2 by
default. It means: As soon as more than 2 registers need to be saved, then
bank switching is performed.

If you need to prevent this, e.g. because you have a recursive function, then
use the __norbank directive:

__norbank void highly_recursive(int x, int y, int z)
{
    ...
}

If you want to force it, even when the to-be-saved registers are smaller than
treshold, then use the __rbank directive:

__rbank void always_use_bankswitching(int x)
{
    ...
}

ISRs:

__interrupt __rbank void irq(void)
{
    ...
}
