QNICE Monitor is the "Operating System"
=======================================

!! DOCUMENT IS WORK-IN-PROGRESS (WIP) !!

Document at least these things:

* How Monitor is our OS today
* Interplay between PORE and MONITOR
* Where the OS functions are documented (and link to some demos)
* How to call OS functions (SYSCALL) and why to use SYSCALL
* How VBCC and the standard C library interact with Monitor and how
  Monitor is a separate target (mention "machine" vs "target" in VBCC)
* How to use Monitor functions in your C code using qmon.h
* How to make and to publish new OS functions (asm, VASM, VBCC)
