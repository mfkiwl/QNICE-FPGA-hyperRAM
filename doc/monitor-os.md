=======================================

!! DOCUMENT IS WORK-IN-PROGRESS (WIP) !!

Document at least these things:

* How Monitor is our OS today
* Interplay between PORE and MONITOR
* Where the OS functions are documented (and link to some demos)
* How to call OS functions (SYSCALL) and why to use SYSCALL
* How to make new OS functions
