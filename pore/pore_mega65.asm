; PORE ROM
; Power On & Reset Execution ROM
;
; This code is executed on power on and on each reset of the system,
; even before any standard operating system like the Monitor is being
; executed from ROM address 0.
;
; The code relies on Monitor libraries and therefore directly includes
; them from the monitor subdirectory without using dist_kit.
